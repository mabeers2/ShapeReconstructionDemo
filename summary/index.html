    <p>The veridical slant (15 Degrees) is shown as a dashed red line.</p>
    <p>The constraints of bilateral symmetry and perspective theoretically yield a unique reconstruction when combined, but this relies on computation of a vanishing point. When angle s is larger, the vanishing point computation is more reliable and therefore perspective is a more reliable cue. On average the subjects reported slightly more veridical reconstructions as perspective information became more reliable. Did you? </p>
    <p>Thank you for looking at this demo. </p>
